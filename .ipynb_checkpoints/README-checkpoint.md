# Global Alcohol Consumption by Countries Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between alcohol consumption per capita and the prevalence of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) across different countries, 
while considering the economic impact measured by GDP per capita. 
The aim is to identify patterns and provide insights into how alcohol consumption is related to health outcomes on a global scale.

## Objectives
- To clean and visualize data on alcohol consumption in the world
- To explore the direct correlation between alcohol consumption and AUD prevalence.
- To adjust this relationship for GDP per capita to identify economic impacts.
- To visualize the data and findings using advanced data visualization techniques.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on publicly available data from:
- **Our World in Data**: Provides comprehensive data on global health, including alcohol consumption metrics and GDP per capita for all countries.
- **World Health Organization**: Offers data on alcohol use disroder (AUD) prevalence across the countries.

## Installation and Setup
Ensure you have Python installed, and then set up a virtual environment for the project.

1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/nikitamitkin/Exam-HEL8048.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
cd <project-repository>

3. **Install dependencies**:
- With Conda:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```
- With pip:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis:

## Visualizations
The project includes several custom visualizations:
- Histograms of alcohol consumption by country and in the world
- Scatter plot (interactive) illustrating relationship between alcohol drinking level and GDP per capita
- Scatter plots showing the correlation between alcohol consumption and AUD prevalence.
- Regression analysis plots with and without adjustment for GDP.
